### Prompt 1

my substack strategy implies automations and llms, is it?

### Prompt 2

rewrite this text to detail merge my knowledge with astrology, in great detail I’m a multi-specialist working at the intersection of AI/ML, structured data, knowledge transfer, software engineering and product managemnt.

Check my meeting transcription system: it doesn’t just transcribe audio. It understands context, extracts action items, identifies risks and structures knowledge in ways that make meetings actually useful.

Every week, I share tricks and hacks.

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 4

do it

### Prompt 5

remove meeting transcription refs. Don't write like I am building or using pipelines. Write like I am astrologist with a data science background. All manual work. remember this and rephrame. make me authoritative. We manually process your birth data through a multi-stage pipeline. First, Astrolog 7.80 (Swiss Ephemeris) computes exact positions for 20 celestial bodies and maps 50+ aspect configurations with precise orbs. We then extract your chart’s unique statistical signature — planetary we...

its' better but make it more interesting and unusual, many people laugh on astrology, don't let them

write subtitle

### Prompt 8

very good now write me 3 extremely interesting and diverse posts for substack. Like geniously interesting without vague data make me a thought leader, save them as SUBSTACK_POSTS.md

### Prompt 9

make it even better, scientific level but also making people want to get my reports

### Prompt 10

validate for halucinations so no professional astrologer could doubt it or disagree

### Prompt 12

validate for halucinations so no professional astrologer could doubt it or disagree , make sure all is based on my REALreports that are in examples, also make it really interesting for common not smart people too, not only scientific level

### Prompt 13

now make a crystal clear prompt instructions, for creating and validating super strong and genius content and save it to docs, it must include everything you learned in this session ic bullet proof form

### Prompt 14

check every doc in docs/ including strategies and update them based on what we did in the couple of days, check git history

### Prompt 15

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **User asks about Substack strategy** - "my substack strategy implies automations and llms, is it?" - I searched the codebase and found that the Substack strategy is manual/human-voice, not automated.

2. **User asks for text rewrite** - Wanted to merge their tech background (AI/ML, ...

but I want american customers too, and emphasize manual work, what category?

### Prompt 20

This policy actually settles both debates definitively.

**Item #2 (Prohibited) - "Manual Digital Services"** kills the "made by hand" framing:

> "if the majority of the value sits in the human labour rather than digital systems, it will not be accepted"

Claiming hand-crafted reports would literally move you INTO a prohibited category. Your website copy about "written, proofread, and checked by hand" is a liability with Dodo, not an asset. The AI/automated pipeline is what makes you acceptable...

### Prompt 21

apply all changes, push to github

### Prompt 22

rewrite substack articles and about

### Prompt 23

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 24

offer, do I need to rewrite substack articles and about? I spent years building systems that extract structure from chaos - knowledge graphs, structured data pipelines, the kind of engineering where you take a mess of raw signal and find what’s actually there.

Then I pointed that lens at astrology.

Here’s what most people don’t know: a birth chart isn’t a horoscope. It’s a precise astronomical snapshot - 20 celestial bodies plotted against ecliptic longitude at the exact minute of yo...

change settings so you do it automatically, and i will restart

### Prompt 31

wait , you wrote dangerous shit that is visible to dodo like "Remove 'by hand' / 'manually' copy for Dodo Payments com" jeezus you shouldnt , remove such incriminating stuff from visible commits
