              <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>We compute your exact birth chart using Astrolog 7.80, a professional astronomical engine built on Swiss Ephemeris. This calculates positions for 20 celestial bodies, all aspect configurations with precise orbs, and 12 Placidus house placements. Our interpretation system then analyzes each configuration through 13 specialized modules grounded in the traditions of psychological astrology (Liz Greene), aspect analysis (Robert Hand), and evolutionary astrology (Steven Forrest).</p>

              <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Most services use only your Sun sign or brief template paragraphs. We analyze 20 celestial bodies (including 5 asteroids and 5 sensitive points), 9 aspect types (including minors like semi-square and quincunx), and interpret each aspect with its exact orb. The natal report alone is over 40 pages of original analysis. Written natively in 3 languages &mdash; not translated.</p>
